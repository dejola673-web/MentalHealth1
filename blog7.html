              <h4><i class="bi bi-lightbulb"></i> What Are Eating Disorders?</h4>
              <p>Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions that can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or body size. They're characterized by severe disturbances in eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. These aren't simply about food—they often serve as ways to cope with emotional pain, stress, or feelings of lack of control.</p>
              <p>Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, making early intervention critical. They affect approximately 9% of the population worldwide and can lead to serious physical complications affecting the heart, bones, digestive system, and more. However, with proper treatment and support, recovery is absolutely possible.</p>

                <p>Early detection significantly improves recovery outcomes. Watch for warning signs including dramatic weight loss or fluctuation, preoccupation with food and calories, ritualistic eating behaviors, excessive exercise, frequent bathroom trips after meals, wearing baggy clothes to hide body shape, and social withdrawal from activities involving food. Physical signs may include dizziness, fainting, feeling cold, stomach problems, sleep difficulties, concentration problems, and irregular or absent menstrual periods. If you notice these signs in yourself or a loved one, reach out for professional help immediately.</p>

                <h3>Seek Comprehensive Medical Assessment</h3>
                <p>Eating disorders can cause serious medical complications that require monitoring and treatment. Schedule a complete medical evaluation that includes assessment of vital signs, heart function, bone density, nutritional status, and any other affected systems. Medical stabilization is often the first step in treatment, as physical health complications can be life-threatening. Your treatment team should include medical doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, and nutritionists who work together to address all aspects of the disorder. Don't let shame or fear prevent you from getting the medical care you need—healthcare providers are there to help, not judge.</p>

                  <p>Also called the Maudsley Approach, FBT is highly effective for adolescents. Parents take an active role in helping restore their child's weight and eating patterns before gradually returning control to the teen.</p>

                <h3>Choose the Right Level of Care</h3>
                <p>Treatment for eating disorders exists on a spectrum from outpatient to inpatient care. Outpatient therapy involves regular sessions while living at home—ideal for those medically stable. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) provide several hours of treatment multiple days per week. Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) offer full-day treatment with return home at night. Residential treatment provides 24/7 care in a home-like setting for those needing intensive support. Inpatient hospitalization is reserved for medical emergencies and severe cases requiring constant monitoring. Your treatment team will help determine the most appropriate level of care based on medical stability, psychological symptoms, and social support.</p>

Be patient with yourself on difficult days and remember that setbacks are opportunities to learn, not signs of failure.

                <h3>Create a Relapse Prevention Plan</h3>
                <p>As you progress in recovery, work with your treatment team to develop a relapse prevention plan. Identify your personal warning signs that you might be slipping back into eating disorder behaviors. List healthy coping strategies you can use when you notice these signs. Include emergency contacts for when you need immediate support. Establish regular check-ins with your treatment team even when you're doing well. Remember that having a plan doesn't mean you'll relapse—it means you're prepared to catch any slips early and get back on track quickly.

                <div class="truth-label">TRUTH</div>
                <p>Eating disorders affect people of all ages, genders, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Men, older adults, and people in larger bodies can and do develop eating disorders.</p>

                <div class="truth-label">TRUTH</div>
                <p>People with eating disorders come in all shapes and sizes. You cannot determine the severity of an eating disorder based on someone's weight or appearance. Many people suffering from serious eating disorders are in "normal" or larger bodies.</p>

                <div class="truth-label">TRUTH</div>
                <p>Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses with biological, psychological, and social causes. They're often about control, coping with emotions, trauma, or perfectionism—not simply about appearance.</p>

                <div class="truth-label">TRUTH</div>
                <p>Eating disorders involve complex changes in brain function and are not a choice or matter of willpower. Recovery requires professional treatment addressing medical, nutritional, and psychological aspects.</p>
