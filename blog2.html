              Anxiety affects millions of people worldwide, but it doesn't have to control your life. Learning effective coping strategies can help you manage anxious thoughts and feelings, allowing you to live more peacefully. Here are seven proven techniques to help you navigate anxiety with confidence.
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 1 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-wind"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>1. Practice Deep Breathing Exercises</h3>
                <p>Deep breathing is one of the fastest ways to calm your nervous system. Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This activates your body's relaxation response and helps reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. Practice this for just 5 minutes daily, especially during moments of stress.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 2 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-chat-dots"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>2. Challenge Negative Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Anxiety often stems from catastrophic thinking patterns. When you notice anxious thoughts, pause and ask yourself: "Is this thought based on facts or feelings?" Write down your worries and examine the evidence for and against them. This cognitive reframing helps you gain perspective and reduces the power anxiety has over you.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 3 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-eye"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>3. Use the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h3>
                <p>When anxiety overwhelms you, ground yourself in the present moment. Identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This sensory awareness exercise interrupts anxious thoughts and brings you back to reality, reducing panic and worry.</p>

            <!-- Tip 4 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-lightning"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>4. Engage in Regular Physical Activity</h3>
                <p>Exercise is a natural anxiety reliever that boosts mood-enhancing endorphins and reduces stress hormones like cortisol. You don't need intense workouts—even a 20-minute walk, yoga session, or dance break can significantly reduce anxiety levels. Find an activity you enjoy and make it a consistent part of your routine.</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Tip 5 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-clock-history"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>5. Set Aside "Worry Time"</h3>
                <p>Instead of letting anxiety consume your entire day, schedule 15-20 minutes of dedicated "worry time." When anxious thoughts arise outside this window, acknowledge them and postpone them until your scheduled time. This technique helps contain anxiety and prevents it from spreading throughout your day, giving you more mental freedom.</p>

            <!-- Tip 6 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">

              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>6. Limit Caffeine and Alcohol</h3>
                <p>Both caffeine and alcohol can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Caffeine stimulates your nervous system and can trigger panic-like sensations, while alcohol disrupts sleep and can worsen anxiety during withdrawal. Consider reducing your intake or switching to herbal teas and other calming alternatives to support your mental health.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>7. Build a Strong Support Network</h3>
                <p>Don't face anxiety alone. Share your feelings with trusted friends, family members, or a therapist who can offer support and perspective. Joining a support group—whether in person or online—can help you feel less isolated and provide valuable coping strategies from others who understand what you're experiencing.</p>

              <h4>You Have the Power to Manage Anxiety</h4>
              <p>Remember that managing anxiety is a journey, not a destination. These strategies work best when practiced regularly, not just during moments of crisis. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if anxiety significantly impacts your daily life. You deserve to feel calm and in control.</p>
