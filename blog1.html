              Taking care of your mental health doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. Small daily actions can make a big difference in your overall wellbeing. Here are five evidence-based practices you can start implementing today.
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 1 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-sunrise"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>1. Start Your Day with Intention.</h3>
                <p>Instead of reaching for your phone first thing in the morning, take a moment to breathe deeply and set a positive intention for the day. This simple act can help calm your mind and give you a sense of control. Try spending just 2-3 minutes focusing on your breath and thinking about what you want to accomplish or how you want to feel throughout the day.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 2 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-person-walking"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>2. Move Your Body, Even just a Little.</h3>
                <p>You don't need an intense workout to feel the benefits of movement. Try walking, stretching, or dancing to your favorite music. Physical activity releases endorphins and helps improve your mood. Even a 10-minute walk can reduce stress and increase energy levels. The key is consistency, not intensity.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 3 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-people"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>3. Stay Connected.</h3>
                <p>Reach out to friends or family regularly — even a quick message can make a difference. Social connection strengthens emotional resilience and reduces loneliness. Studies show that maintaining strong social bonds is one of the most important factors in long-term mental health and happiness. Schedule regular check-ins with loved ones, even if brief.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 4 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-phone-vibrate"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>4. Limit Screen Time.</h3>
                <p>Too much scrolling can increase anxiety and disrupt sleep. Create boundaries — like avoiding your phone an hour before bed or during meals — to give your mind a chance to recharge. Consider using app timers or scheduling "digital detox" periods throughout your day to disconnect and be present in the moment.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Tip 5 -->
            <div class="tip-card">
              <div class="tip-icon">
                <i class="bi bi-journal-text"></i>
              </div>
              <div class="tip-content">
                <h3>5. Practice Gratitude.</h3>
                <p>Each night, write down three things you're grateful for. Gratitude refocuses your thoughts on positivity and helps build long-term emotional strength. This practice has been shown to improve mood, reduce depression, and increase overall life satisfaction. Keep a gratitude journal by your bedside and make it part of your evening routine.</p>

              <p>"You don't have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you."</p>

              <h4>The Power of Small Steps</h4>
              <p>Remember, improving your mental health doesn't require drastic change — just small, consistent habits. Each mindful action strengthens your wellbeing over time. Start with one or two of these practices and gradually build them into your daily routine. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.</p>
